This is commonlt used when we need to iterate over a sequnce and also requre the index or position of each element."

    "2. Improved Performance: Multithreading can utilize multiple CPU cores, leading to better performance in parallelizable tasks and I/O-bound operations.\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Deadlocks**:\n",
    "A deadlock occurs in multithreaded programming when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources they hold. In a deadlock situation, the threads are unable to proceed because the required resources are held by other threads in the deadlock chain. This can lead to a program becoming unresponsive or stuck indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks typically occur when the following four conditions are simultaneously satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mutual Exclusion: The resources involved are non-sharable, meaning only one thread can use a resource at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hold and Wait: A thread holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a thread; they can only be released voluntarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Circular Wait: A circular chain of threads exists, where each thread in the chain is waiting for a resource held by the next thread in the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent deadlocks, strategies like resource ordering, deadlock avoidance algorithms, or using synchronization primitives effectively can be employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Race Condition**\n",
    "A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the relative ordering or timing of events, particularly when multiple threads access shared data concurrently, and the outcome of their execution becomes non-deterministic. Race conditions can lead to incorrect or unpredictable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions typically occur when the following conditions are met:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shared Data: Two or more threads access shared data or resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Non-atomic Operations: The shared data is modified through non-atomic operations, meaning that multiple instructions are required to read or write the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Unsynchronized Access: The threads do not use proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or mutexes, to coordinate access to the shared data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. When race conditions occur, the outcome can vary depending on the interleaving and timing of thread execution. This can result in data corruption, inconsistent state, or unexpected behavior."
