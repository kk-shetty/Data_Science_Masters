    ">There is no specific limit to the length of an identifier in Python. However, it is recommended to keep identifiers short and descriptive for the sake of code readability. In practice, the maximum length of an identifier is determined by the amount of memory available to the Python interpreter. In general, we should avoid using extremely long identifier names, as they can make the code difficult to read and maintain."

    ">In Python, memory management is handled by the Python memory manager, which is responsible for allocating and freeing memory. The memory manager is part of the Python interpreter, and it automatically manages the memory used by Python objects.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Python uses a garbage collector to automatically track and reclaim objects that are no longer being used. This makes it easy to write Python code that is free of memory leaks, and it reduces the risk of bugs related to memory allocation and deallocation.\n",

To do this, open the System Properties, go to the Advanced System Settings, and click the Environment Variables button. Under System Variables, find the Path variable, and click the Edit button. Add the location of the Python executable to the Path variable (e.g., C:\\Python36).\n",
