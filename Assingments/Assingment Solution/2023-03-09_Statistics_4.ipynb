    "1. **Probability Mass Function (PMF)** \n",
    "* *PMF* is used to describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It gives the probability that a discrete random variable takes on a specific value. The PMF maps each possible value of the random variable to its associated probability.\n",

    "* **The Cumulative Density Function (CDF)** describes the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given value. The CDF provides a complete description of the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mathematically, for a random variable X, the CDF is defined as:\n",

    "\n",
    "*   Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. `CDF(x)` is the cumulative probability that the random variable X is less than or equal to x.\n",
    "    2. `P(X <= x)` is the probability of the event \"*X is less than or equal to x.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lets see a practical example to understand why it's used.\n",
    "***Example***:\n",
    "* Suppose you run a coffee shop, and you are interested in analyzing the wait times of customers before they receive their coffee. You collect data on the wait times for a sample of customers and want to understand the probability distribution of these wait times.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let's say the wait times (in minutes) for 10 customers in your sample are as follows: [2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 5].\n",

    "* Step 1: **Empirical CDF** - The empirical CDF (ECDF) is a way to estimate the true CDF based on the observed data. For our example, the ECDF is constructed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each data point, count the number of data points less than or equal to it and divide by the total number of data points.\n",

    "|6|10|1.0|\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 2: Understanding the Results - Using the ECDF, we can answer various questions related to customer wait times:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Probability of Wait Time**: The CDF (or ECDF) allows us to find the probability of a customer waiting less than or equal to a specific time. For example, the probability that a customer waits less than or equal to 4 minutes is 0.7 (70%).\n",
    "    2. **Probability of Waiting within a Range**: We can determine the probability of a customer waiting between two specific times. For instance, the probability that a customer waits between 3 and 5 minutes is P(3 ≤ X ≤ 5) = P(X ≤ 5) - P(X ≤ 2) = 0.9 - 0.2 = 0.7 (70%).\n",
    "    3. **Percentiles**: The CDF helps us find percentiles, which indicate the wait time below which a given percentage of customers fall. For example, the 75th percentile represents the wait time below which 75% of customers fall. In our example, the 75th percentile is 5 minutes.\n",
    "    4. **Comparing Service Efficiency**: By analyzing the CDF, you can compare the service efficiency of different days or times. A day with a higher CDF value at a particular wait time may indicate better service during that time.\n",

    "#### Q3. What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model? Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **normal distribution**, also known as the **Gaussian distribution** or bell curve, is one of the most widely used probability distributions in statistics. It is applicable in various real-world situations where certain conditions are met. Here are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model:\n",
    "1. **Heights of People**: The heights of a large population of adults often follow a normal distribution. Though there may be some variations, the overall distribution tends to resemble a bell curve.\n",
    "2. **Exam Scores**: In a well-designed exam, the scores of a large group of students can be modeled using a normal distribution. This is especially true when the exam is designed to have a reasonable level of difficulty and represents a broad range of student abilities.\n",
    "3. **Distribution of Sample Mean**: Distribution of mean of samples taken from a population will always form a narmal distribution around the mean of the population\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of the distribution is determined by two parameters: the `mean (μ)` and the `standard deviation (σ)`. These parameters play a crucial role in defining the characteristics of the bell-shaped curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean (μ) affects the position of the peak of the distribution:\n",
    "    * If μ is increased, the peak of the distribution shifts to the right.\n",
    "    * If μ is decreased, the peak of the distribution shifts to the left.\n",
    "2. **standard deviation (σ)** influences the spread or width of the distribution:\n",
    "    * A small σ results in a narrow and tall bell curve, indicating that data points are concentrated around the mean.\n",
    "    * A large σ results in a wider and flatter bell curve, indicating that data points are more spread out from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When μ = 0 and σ = 1, it is referred to as the standard normal distribution, and it serves as a baseline for comparisons and standardizations.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The **Normanl Distribution** is of significant impostance due to it's widespread occurance in reaal-word phenomena and it's mathematical properties. Some of the key reasons why the normal distribution is essential are:\n",
    "1. **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**: The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution. The mean of the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be equal to the population mean, and the standard deviation of the sampling distribution (also known as the standard error) will be equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n",
    "2. **Data Modeling**: Many natural and social phenomena exhibit a tendency to cluster around a central value with a symmetric distribution. The normal distribution provides an excellent approximation for such cases, allowing researchers and statisticians to model data efficiently.\n",
    "3. **Inference and Hypothesis Testing**: The normal distribution simplifies statistical inference and hypothesis testing, as many parametric tests and confidence intervals assume normality. When the sample size is large enough, the use of normality assumptions often leads to accurate results.\n",
    "4. **Standardization**: The standard normal distribution (with mean 0 and standard deviation 1) facilitates comparison and standardization across different distributions. It allows transforming data into standardized z-scores, making it easier to compare data points from different datasets.\n",

    "* Significance of the Central Limit Theorem:\n",
    "    1. *Confidence in Inference*: The Central Limit Theorem allows statisticians to use normal distribution-based methods, such as Z-tests and t-tests, even when the population distribution is unknown or non-normal. This is because, for large sample sizes, the distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal, regardless of the original population.\n",

For example, when calculating the confidence interval for the population mean, the Central Limit Theorem can be applied to obtain a normally distributed sampling distribution of the sample mean, which is used to make inferences about the population mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "The main assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Sampling**: The samples should be selected randomly from the population of interest. Random sampling ensures that each member of the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample, which helps in avoiding bias in the estimates.\n",
    "2. **Independent Observations**: The individual observations within each sample should be independent of each other. In other words, the value of one observation should not influence or be influenced by the value of another observation in the same sample.\n",
    "3. **Finite Variance**: The population from which the samples are drawn should have a finite variance. If the variance is infinite, the Central Limit Theorem may not hold.\n",
    "4. **Sample Size**: The sample size should be sufficiently large. While there is no strict rule for the minimum sample size, as a general guideline, a sample size of 30 or more is often considered sufficient for the Central Limit Theorem to apply reasonably well. However, larger sample sizes usually yield more accurate results.\n",
    "5. **No Extreme Skewness**: Although the Central Limit Theorem can work with skewed populations, extremely skewed distributions may require larger sample sizes for the sampling distribution of the sample mean to approximate a normal distribution.\n",
