    "\n",
    "**Measures of dispersion**, such as `range`, `variance`, and `standard deviation`, are used to quantify the spread or dispersion of data points within a dataset. They provide valuable information about how the data values are distributed around the central tendency (mean, median, etc.) and how much they deviate from each other. These measures help us understand the variability and spread of the data, which is crucial in statistical analysis and data interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`range`**: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It gives an idea of the spread of the data over the entire range.\n",
    "2. **`variance`**: Variance measures the average of the squared differences from the mean. It indicates how much the data points deviate from the mean value. A higher variance implies more spread or dispersion in the data.\n",
    "3. **`standard deviation`**: Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It represents the average amount of deviation of data points from the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates more dispersion in the data.\n",
