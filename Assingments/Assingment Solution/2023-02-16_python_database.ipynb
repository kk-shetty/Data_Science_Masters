    "\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed in a structured manner to facilitate efficient retrieval, modification, and analysis of that data. Databases are commonly used in various applications and systems to store and handle large amounts of information.\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two different types of database management systems, each with its own characteristics and use cases. Here's a brief differentiation between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "|**SQL**|**NoSQL**|\n",
    "|:------|:--------|\n",
    "|SQL databases are based on a structured, tabular model consisting of tables with predefined schemas. Each table contains rows and columns, where rows represent individual records, and columns represent attributes or fields.|NoSQL databases offer a flexible, schema-less model that allows for dynamic and unstructured data. They are designed to handle large amounts of varied data types, such as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or columnar data.|\n",
    "|SQL databases enforce a rigid schema, meaning that the structure and types of data are predefined. Relationships between tables can be established using primary and foreign keys.|NoSQL databases are designed for scalability and high performance. They can easily distribute data across multiple servers and handle large data volumes and high traffic loads.|\n",
    "|SQL databases use SQL as the standard language for querying and managing data. SQL provides a declarative approach, where you specify what data you want and let the database engine figure out how to retrieve it.|NoSQL databases often use non-SQL languages for querying, such as JavaScript, JSON-like query languages, or even simple key-value retrieval.|\n",
    "|SQL databases typically adhere to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which ensure transactional consistency and reliability.|NoSQL databases may sacrifice ACID compliance to achieve better scalability and performance. They often prioritize eventual consistency, where data changes are propagated to all replicas over time.|"

    "\n",
    "DDL stands for **Data Definition Language**. It is a subset of SQL used to define and manage the structure of a database and its objects, such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints. DDL statements are responsible for creating, modifying, and deleting database objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `CREATE`: The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, or even entire databases.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    age INT,\n",
    "    department VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `DROP`: The DROP statement is used to delete existing database objects, such as tables, views, or indexes. It permanently removes the object and its associated data.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `ALTER`: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or removing columns, modifying constraints, or renaming objects.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `TRUNCATE`: The TRUNCATE statement is used to quickly delete all data from a table, while keeping the table structure intact. It is faster than using the DELETE statement to remove all rows.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",

    "\n",
    "1. `INSERT`: The INSERT statement is used to add new records or rows into a table.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees (id, name, age, department)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 30, 'Sales');\n",

    "SET department = 'Marketing'\n",
    "WHERE id = 1;\n",

    "\n",
    "`Foreign Key`: A foreign key establishes a link between two tables, referencing the primary key of another table. It maintains referential integrity by ensuring that the values in the foreign key column(s) correspond to existing values in the referenced primary key column(s). Foreign keys help define relationships between tables and maintain consistency in the database."
