    "#### Q1. What is Statistics?\n",
    "**Statistics** is the science of *collecting*, *organising* and *analyzing* te data.\n",
    "___\n",
    "#### Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.\n",
    "Statistics can be broadly divided into two types:\n",
    "1. Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "2. Inferential Statstics\n",
    "\t\n",
    "**Descriptive Statistics**: Unders descriptive statistics we organize and summarize the data. We use *measure of central tendency*, *measure of dispertion* and *graphs* in this stage. The descriptive statistics is used to when we want to summarize a large data to understand the hopw well the sample data is spread or where is the more concentration etc.\n",
    "*Example*: Suppose we want to know the median population of all major cities in India. Here we are using measure of central tendency to check what is the median population size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inferential Statistics**: This consist of using the data we have measured inorder t form a conculsion. There are various testing such as *z-test*, *t-test* and *hypothesis testing* we perform to get the conclusion.\n",
    "*Example*: From above example if we want to conclude what budget we should allocate for a city based on population size and growth.\n",
    "___\n",
    "#### Q3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of each type of data.\n",
    "**Data** is a fact or a pice of information. It can be mroadly divided into two types. Each type are then sub divided into two typs again.\n",
    "1. **Quantitative** - Numerical data\n",
    "* 1.1 **Discrete** - These are whole numbers with a range. \n",
    "Example : Numbers of people in a house or Number of students in a class.\n",
    "* 1.2 **Continuous** -  Data that can be measured. This data has values that are not fixed and have an infinite number of possible values. \n",
    "Example : the wight of an animal, or length of a river.\n",
    "2. **Qualitative** - Categorical data\n",
    "* 2.1 **Nominal** - These are used to label variables without any quantitative value. they don't have any quantitative or numeric value, and the various categories cannot be placed into any kind of meaningful order or hierarchy. \n",
    "Example : Blood groups, marital status etc.\n",
    "* 2.2 **Ordinal** - these are kind of qualitative data that groups variables into ordered categories, which have a natural order or rank based on some hierarchal scale, like from high to low.\n",
    "Example : Income level (Lower-class, Middle-class or Upper-class) , language ability (Beginner, Intermediate or Fluent)\n",
    "___\n",
    "#### Q4. Categorise the following datasets with respect to quantitative and qualitative data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Grading in exam: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, E - **[Ordinal data]**\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) Colour of mangoes: yellow, green, orange, red - **[Nominal data]**\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) Height data of a class: [178.9, 179, 179.5, 176, 177.2, 178.3, 175.8,...] - **[Continuous data]**\n",
    "\n",
    "(iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: [500, 600, 478, 672, ...] - **[Discrete Data]**\n",
    "___\n",
    "#### Q5. Explain the concept of levels of measurement and give an example of a variable for each level.\n",
    "**Level of Measurement** also called as **Scale of measurement** tells us how precisely variables are records. The level at which we measure a variable determines how we can analyze your data.\n",
    "There are four levels of measurement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nominal Scale data**: The data can only be categorized without any ordering. Example - city of birth, gender of students\n",
    "2. **Ordinal Scale data**: We can categorizeank these variable in an order but we cannot say anything about the interval between the rankings. Example - Language ability, User reviews.\n",
    "3. **Interval Scale data**: We can categorize, rank, and infer equal intervals between neighboring data points, but there is no true zero point. Example: Temperature values, IQ level\n",
    "4. **Ratio Scale data**: We can categorize, rank, infer equal intervals betwee neghbouring data paoints and there is a true zero point. The difference and ratio are measurable. Example : height, weight an age.\n",
    "___\n",
    "#### Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an example to illustrate your answer.\n",
    "It is importatnt to understand the level of measurement because the level at which we measure a variable determines how we can analyze our data.\n",
    "In many cases, your variables can be measured at different levels, so we have to choose the level of measurement we will use before data collection begins.\n",
    "For example - we can measure the variable of income at an ordinal or ratio level.\n",
    "1. Ordinal level: We create brackets of income ranges: Rs 0 - Rs 30,000, Rs 30,000– Rs 60,000, and Rs 60,000 – Rs 1,00,000. We ask participants to select the bracket that represents their annual income. The brackets are coded with numbers from 1–3.\n",
    "2. Ratio level: You collect data on the exact annual incomes of your participants.\n",
    "___\n",
    "#### Q7. How nominal data type is different from ordinal data type.\n",
    "Nominal data types just categorizes the variables but there are no order of these categories. Where as the orinal data types have ranking/order of their category. For example, The colur of the fruit is a nominal data type which doesn't have any order, but the size of the fruit (small, medium or large) has an order.\n",
    "___\n",
    "#### Q8. Which type of plot can be used to display data in terms of range?\n",
    "We can display range data in *Histogram** plot.\n",
    "___\n",
    "#### Q9. Describe the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics. Give an example of each type of statistics and explain how they are used.\n",
    "|Category|Descriptive Statistics|Inferential Statistics|\n",
    "|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n",
    "|Purpose|Describe and summarize data|Make inferences and draw conclusions about a population based on sample data|\n",
    "|Analysis|Analyzes and interprets the characteristics of a dataset|Uses sample data to make generalizations or predictions about a larger population|\n",
    "|Population vs Sample|Focuses on the entire population or dataset|Focuses on a subset of the population (sample) to draw conclusions about the entire population|\n",
    "|Measurements|Provides measures of central tendency and dispersion|Estimates parameters, tests hypotheses, and determines the level of confidence or significance in the results|\n",
    "|Goal|Summarize, organize, and present data|Generalize findings to a larger population, make predictions, test hypotheses, evaluate relationships, and support decision-making|\n",
    "|Example|Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range, frequency tables|Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, ANOVA (analysis of variance), chi-square tests, t-tests, etc.|\n",
    "___\n",
    "#### Q10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.\n",
    "**Measure of Centra; tendency** help us find the middle or the average of a dataset. The three most common measure of central tendency are the mode, median, and mean.\n",
    "1. **mode**: the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. It’s possible to have no mode, one mode, or more than one mode. To find the mode, sort the dataset numerically or categorically and select the response that occurs most frequently.\n",
    "2. **median**:  the value that’s exactly in the middle when it is ordered from low to high. To find the median, we first order all values from low to high. Then, find the value in the middle of the ordered dataset\n",
    "3. **mean**: the sum of all values divided by the total number of values. It’s the most commonly used measure of central tendency because all values are used in the calculation. Outliers can significantly increase or decrease the mean when they are included in the calculation. Since all values are used to calculate the mean, it can be affected by extreme outliers. An outlier is a value that differs significantly from the others in a dataset.\n",
