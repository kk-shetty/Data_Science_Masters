#### Q1. <span style="color:magenta">What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.</span>
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines how different software components should interact, specifying the types of requests that can be made, the data formats to be used, and the expected responses.

An example where an API is used in real life is when you use a weather application or website to retrieve the current weather information for a specific location. The weather application doesn't maintain its own weather data; instead, it relies on an external weather service's API to fetch the required weather information.
